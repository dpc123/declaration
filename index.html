    <h1>>Haverhill & District u3a Gift Aid Declaration</h1>
    <p>You can boost your donation by 25p of Gift Aid for each £1 you donate in membership fees with Gift Aid. </p>

        <p>Gift Aid is reclaimed by the charity from the tax you pay for the current tax year.</p>
        
        <p> It costs you nothing.</p>
        
        <p> Your full address is needed to identify you as a current UK taxpayer.</p>
        
        <p> If you pay Income Tax at the higher rate and want us to receive the additional tax relief due to you, you must include all your Gift Aid donations on your Self-Assessment tax return or ask HMRC to adjust your tax code.</p>
        
        <p> This mandate will continue every year until you cancel it.</p>
        
        <p> Please notify the charity if you:</p>
            <ul>   
        <li> to cancel this declaration.</li>
        <li>change your name or home address.</li>
        <li>change your name or home address.</li>
